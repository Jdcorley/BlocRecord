# BlocRecord

## An ActiveRecord-esque ORM adaptor created during my bootcamp at Bloc.

### BlocRecord was a project I completed during my database module at Bloc to gain further understanding of object relational mapping and sharpen my understanding of Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord.

  -BlocRecord was also used for data persistence in my earlier project [AddressBloc](https://github.com/Jdcorley/AddressBloc) a cli that recieved user input of address information.
